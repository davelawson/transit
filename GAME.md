# Transit
## Vision
A simple turn-based game where the player builds and manages a transportation network and attempts to meet the demands of an ever-growing federation of towns.  The player builds links between towns and assigns vehicles to carry goods from towns that produce to towns that demand the good.  As needs are satisfied, resources are accrued, and the Federation continues to expand.

## Flow of Play
1. Produce

    - Each town generates new products according to their local industry.  

1. Transport

    - Transport Links move products from one town to another.
    - Transport Links are maintained or fall into Disrepair

1. Consume

    - Towns consume products in order to Satisfy outstanding Demands.

1. Towns Act

    - Towns generate Grievances
    - Towns abandon Trade Federations
    - Towns join Trade Federations

1. Player Acts

    - Players Petition Towns to join their Trade Federation
    - Players build or repair Transport Links

## Concepts
### Towns
### Satisfaction
### Federation
### Products
### Transport Link

    Towns may or may not be connected by way of a Transport Link.  This represents a channel through which a Trade Federation may transport goods from one Town to another.

### Goodwill

    Represents a Trade Federation's favour with a specific Town.  A Town can have Goodwill towards multiple Trade Federations at once.
    
### Grievance

    Represents a Town's overall unhappiness.

### Demands

    Each Town has a collection of demands.  When demands are satisfied, the Satisfaction of the Town is increased, and the responsible Trade Federation makes a profit.
    
### Currency

    Trade Federations are paid in Currency, and spend Currency to upgrade their transport network.

### Disrepair
        
    Transport Links fall into Disrepair if they are not maintained.  While in Disrepair, the Transport Link can not be used.  In order to return the Transport Link to service, a Trade Federation needs to spend Currency.

### Petition

    Trade Federations can spend Currency in an attempt to directly generate Goodwill with a Town.

## Potential Expansions

### Multi-Player

Each player would represent a different competing federation of towns.  Towns would be lobbied, and join the federation they most approve of.

### Production Chains

Towns can produce more advanced products that require one or more input products.

### Manpower

Towns don't always have enough manpower to operate all local industry.  The controlling federation needs to assign the available manpower to the available industries during the Produce phase.  Available manpower must be assigned if possible.  Unassigned manpower causes the Towns satisfaction level to drop.

### Variety of Transport Links

Add additional types of Transport Links, such as road, rail, water, air.  Different solutions would imply different ranges, capacities, speeds, costs, and so on.

### Variety of Transport Convoys

Allow the player to create multiple individual convoys to service a given Transport Link.  Allow for multiple types of convoys with different characteristics (ie. speed, capacity, defensibility, cost, etc.).

### Banditry

### Town Politics
